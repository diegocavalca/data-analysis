===== WEEK 1 =====
Data Analysis

-> Steps:
1. Question - Get Answer for question ou solve a problem
2. Wrangle - Data Acquisition and Data Cleaning
3. Explore - Building Intuitions and find patterns (stats, clustering, etc.)
4. Conclusion - Classifications, predictions and so on. (Here ML comes in!)
5. Communicate - Blog Post, Presentation, paper, email, and .. DataViz (reporting)!

P.s.: 
-> Theses steps are not linear, mainly in 2 and 3 steps: there are cycling issues!
-> Wrangling:
	- Data Acquisition: File, API, Scrapping, ... COMBINING (and structuring all these)!.


===== WEEK 2 =====
 Series (in Python Pandas) : It's similar to list and dictionary.
 	- Contains indexes values for each row
 		and columns with values (tabular structure)

 	- Eg.: pd.Series(ELEMENT[LIST or DICT])

 	- Missing Data: 
 		- Strings: MD is denoted as 'None'
 		- Numbers: MD is denoted as Nan (Not a Number)

 	P.s.: NaN <> None, and to test if a number (value X in Series) is equal
 		NaN, we should use 'np.isNan(X)' to do that. Underneath, numpy is 
 		handling numbers in Pandas Series.
