    "In order to understand our data, we can look at each variable and try to understand their meaning and relevance to this problem. I know this is time-consuming, but it will give us the flavour of our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to have some discipline in our analysis, we can create an Excel spreadsheet with the following columns:\n",
    "* <b>Variable</b> - Variable name.\n",
    "* <b>Type</b> - Identification of the variables' type. There are two possible values for this field: 'numerical' or 'categorical'. By 'numerical' we mean variables for which the values are numbers, and by 'categorical' we mean variables for which the values are categories.\n",
    "* <b>Segment</b> - Identification of the variables' segment. We can define three possible segments: building, space or location. When we say 'building', we mean a variable that relates to the physical characteristics of the building (e.g. 'OverallQual'). When we say 'space', we mean a variable that reports space properties of the house (e.g. 'TotalBsmtSF'). Finally, when we say a 'location', we mean a variable that gives information about the place where the house is located (e.g. 'Neighborhood').\n",
    "* <b>Expectation</b> - Our expectation about the variable influence in 'SalePrice'. We can use a categorical scale with 'High', 'Medium' and 'Low' as possible values.\n",
    "* <b>Conclusion</b> - Our conclusions about the importance of the variable, after we give a quick look at the data. We can keep with the same categorical scale as in 'Expectation'.\n",
    "* <b>Comments</b> - Any general comments that occured to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "While 'Type' and 'Segment' is just for possible future reference, the column 'Expectation' is important because it will help us develop a 'sixth sense'. To fill this column, we should read the description of all the variables and, one by one, ask ourselves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do we think about this variable when we are buying a house? (e.g. When we think about the house of our dreams, do we care about its 'Masonry veneer type'?).\n",
    "* If so, how important would this variable be? (e.g. What is the impact of having 'Excellent' material on the exterior instead of 'Poor'? And of having 'Excellent' instead of 'Good'?).\n",
    "* Is this information already described in any other variable? (e.g. If 'LandContour' gives the flatness of the property, do we really need to know the 'LandSlope'?).\n",
    "\n",
    "After this daunting exercise, we can filter the spreadsheet and look carefully to the variables with 'High' 'Expectation'. Then, we can rush into some scatter plots between those variables and 'SalePrice', filling in the 'Conclusion' column which is just the correction of our expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "I went through this process and concluded that the following variables can play an important role in this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* OverallQual (which is a variable that I don't like because I don't know how it was computed; a funny exercise would be to predict 'OverallQual' using all the other variables available).\n",
    "* YearBuilt.\n",
    "* TotalBsmtSF.\n",
    "* GrLivArea.\n",
    "\n",
    "I ended up with two 'building' variables ('OverallQual' and 'YearBuilt') and two 'space' variables ('TotalBsmtSF' and 'GrLivArea'). This might be a little bit unexpected as it goes against the real estate mantra that all that matters is 'location, location and location'. It is possible that this quick data examination process was a bit harsh for categorical variables. For example, I expected the 'Neigborhood' variable to be more relevant, but after the data examination I ended up excluding it. Maybe this is related to the use of scatter plots instead of boxplots, which are more suitable for categorical variables visualization. The way we visualize data often influences our conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the main point of this exercise was to think a little about our data and expectactions, so I think we achieved our goal. Now it's time for 'a little less conversation, a little more action please'. Let's <b>shake it!</b>"

This means that we will not try any trick to fill the missing data in these cases. According to this, there is a set of variables (e.g. 'PoolQC', 'MiscFeature', 'Alley', etc.) that we should delete. The point is: will we miss this data? I don't think so. None of these variables seem to be very important, since most of them are not aspects in which we think about when buying a house (maybe that's the reason why data is missing?). Moreover, looking closer at the variables, we could say that variables like 'PoolQC', 'MiscFeature' and 'FireplaceQu' are strong candidates for outliers, so we'll be happy to delete them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what concerns the remaining cases, we can see that 'Garage*X*' variables have the same number of missing data. I bet missing data refers to the same set of observations (although I will not check it; it's just 5% and we should not spend 20$ in 5$ problems). Since the most important information regarding garages is expressed by 'GarageCars' and considering that we are just talking about 5% of missing data, I'll delete the mentioned 'Garage*X*' variables. The same logic applies to 'Bsmt*X*' variables.\n",
    "\n",

    "In Ayn Rand's novel, 'Atlas Shrugged', there is an often-repeated question: who is John Galt? A big part of the book is about the quest to discover the answer to this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "I feel Randian now. Who is 'SalePrice'?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to this question lies in testing for the assumptions underlying the statistical bases for multivariate analysis. We already did some data cleaning and discovered a lot about 'SalePrice'. Now it's time to go deep and understand how 'SalePrice' complies with the statistical assumptions that enables us to apply multivariate techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Hair et al. (2013), four assumptions should be tested:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Normality</b> - When we talk about normality what we mean is that the data should look like a normal distribution. This is important because several statistic tests rely  on this (e.g. t-statistics). In this exercise we'll just check univariate normality for 'SalePrice' (which is a limited approach). Remember that univariate normality doesn't ensure multivariate normality (which is what we would like to have), but it helps. Another detail to take into account is that in big samples (>200 observations) normality is not such an issue. However, if we solve normality, we avoid a lot of other problems (e.g. heteroscedacity) so that's the main reason why we are doing this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Homoscedasticity</b> - I just hope I wrote it right. Homoscedasticity refers to the 'assumption that dependent variable(s) exhibit equal levels of variance across the range of predictor variable(s)' (Hair et al., 2013). Homoscedasticity is desirable because we want the error term to be the same across all values of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Linearity</b>- The most common way to assess linearity is to examine scatter plots and search for linear patterns. If patterns are not linear, it would be worthwhile to explore data transformations. However, we'll not get into this because most of the scatter plots we've seen appear to have linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Absence of correlated errors</b> - Correlated errors, like the definition suggests, happen when one error is correlated to another. For instance, if one positive error makes a negative error systematically, it means that there's a relationship between these variables. This occurs often in time series, where some patterns are time related. We'll also not get into this. However, if you detect something, try to add a variable that can explain the effect you're getting. That's the most common solution for correlated errors.\n",

    "Throughout this kernel we put in practice many of the strategies proposed by Hair et al. (2013). We philosophied about the variables, we analysed 'SalePrice' alone and with the most correlated variables, we dealt with missing data and outliers, we tested some of the fundamental statistical assumptions and we even transformed categorial variables into dummy variables. That's a lot of work that Python helped us make easier.\n",

    "But the quest is not over. Remember that our story stopped in the Facebook research. Now it's time to give a call to 'SalePrice' and invite her to dinner. Try to predict her behaviour. Do you think she's a girl that enjoys regularized linear regression approaches? Or do you think she prefers ensemble methods? Or maybe something else?\n",
